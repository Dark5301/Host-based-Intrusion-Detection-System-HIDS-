Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)

Overview

This project implements a Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) that monitors system activity, detects anomalies, and alerts users about potential security threats. The system consists of several components, including log analysis, process monitoring, file integrity checking, and network monitoring.

Features

Log Analysis: Analyzes system logs to detect suspicious activity.

Process Monitoring: Tracks running processes to identify unauthorized or abnormal behavior.

File Integrity Monitoring: Detects unauthorized changes to critical files.

Network Monitoring: Observes network activity for potential threats.

Alerting System: Notifies users when security incidents are detected.

Centralized Execution Script: Runs all HIDS components together for comprehensive monitoring.

Components

alerting_system.py: Handles alerts and notifications for detected threats.

file_integrity_monitoring.py: Monitors file changes and integrity.

hids_logger.py: Provides logging functionality for all HIDS modules.

log_analysis.py: Analyzes log files for suspicious events.

network_monitoring.py: Monitors network traffic for anomalies.

process_monitoring.py: Observes running processes for unusual activity.

run_hids.py: Main script to execute the HIDS system.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd hids_project

Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the HIDS system:

python run_hids.py

Usage

Ensure the system has the necessary permissions to monitor logs, files, and processes.

Modify configuration settings as needed for your security policies.

Check logs and alerts regularly to respond to security threats.
